" CONFIGURATION
" You need to make the plugin available as a ctrlp.vim extension. Please add funky to a variable g:ctrlp_extensions.
let g:ctrlp_extensions = ['funky']
" Reboot Vim and then you can use :CtrlPFunky command.

" It might be useful key mappings like:
nnoremap <Leader>fu :CtrlPFunky<Cr>
" narrow the list down with a word under cursor
nnoremap <Leader>fU :execute 'CtrlPFunky ' . expand('<cword>')<Cr>

" SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING (experimental)
" I'd like to introduce one of ctrlp-funky options. Do you want to make ctrlp-funky funkier? Okay - you can do it just 1 line config.
let g:ctrlp_funky_syntax_highlight = 1
